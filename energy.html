                <img src="./images/renewable.webp" alt="Renewable Energy">
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Renewable energy comes from sources that are naturally replenished, such as sunlight, wind, rain, and geothermal heat. These sources are sustainable and have a much lower environmental impact compared to fossil fuels.</p>
                <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Renewable energy plays a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions, combating climate change, and providing a sustainable energy future for the world. It is essential for reducing dependency on fossil fuels and increasing energy security.</p>
                <p>Wind power, solar energy, and hydropower are the most commonly used renewable energy sources, helping to power homes, industries, and transportation systems globally.</p>

                <h3>Fossil Fuels</h3>

                <img src="./images/fossil.jpeg" alt="Fossil Fuels">
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Fossil fuels are non-renewable energy resources that include coal, oil, and natural gas. They are formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals and are primarily used for electricity generation, heating, and transportation.</p>
                <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Fossil fuels have been the primary source of energy for centuries and power most of the worldâ€™s industries, transportation, and electricity. However, their extraction and use are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation.</p>
                <p>Efforts to transition to cleaner energy alternatives are essential to mitigate the negative impacts of fossil fuel consumption, such as air pollution and global warming.</p>
                <p><strong>Conservation Methods:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Reduce reliance on fossil fuels by increasing efficiency and transitioning to cleaner alternatives.</li>
                  <li>Support carbon capture and storage technologies to reduce emissions.</li>
                  <li>Encourage the use of electric vehicles and public transportation to reduce fossil fuel consumption.</li>
                  <li>Promote energy-efficient appliances and buildings to reduce overall energy demand.</li>
                  <li>Implement policies to limit fossil fuel exploration and production in ecologically sensitive areas.</li>

                <h3>Nuclear Energy</h3>
                <img src="./images/nuclear.jpeg" alt="Nuclear Energy">
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Nuclear energy is produced through the process of nuclear fission, where atoms of radioactive elements like uranium are split to release energy. This energy is used to generate electricity in nuclear power plants.</p>
                <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Nuclear energy is a low-carbon source of electricity, playing a role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It is highly efficient and provides a significant amount of power, especially in countries with high energy demands.</p>
                <p>Despite its efficiency, nuclear energy poses risks related to radioactive waste, safety concerns, and the potential for accidents. Public perception and environmental concerns are important considerations when expanding nuclear energy.</p>
                <p><strong>Conservation Methods:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Improve the safety and security of nuclear plants to prevent accidents.</li>

            <h3>Fold Mountains</h3>
            <img src="./images/fold mountains.jpg" alt="Fold Mountains">
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Fold mountains are formed when two tectonic plates collide, causing the Earth's crust to fold and create high mountain ranges.</p>
            <p><strong>Importance:</strong> These mountains are often characterized by complex folds and are major geological features that shape the Earth's surface.</p>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong> The Himalayas, the Alps, and the Andes.</p>

            <h3>Block Mountains</h3>
            <img src="./images/block mountains.jpeg" alt="Block Mountains">
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Block mountains are formed by faulting, where large blocks of the Earth's crust are uplifted or dropped, creating steep slopes.</p>
            <p><strong>Importance:</strong> They can create dramatic landscapes and often have flat tops with steep sides.</p>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong> The Sierra Nevada Mountains, the Vosges Mountains.</p>

            <h3>Volcanic Mountains</h3>
            <img src="./images/volcanic mountains.webp" alt="Volcanic Mountains">
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Volcanic mountains are formed by volcanic activity, where magma from the Earth's mantle erupts and solidifies to form mountains.</p>
            <p><strong>Importance:</strong> These mountains are often conical in shape and play a crucial role in the Earth's geological processes.</p>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Mount Fuji, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Kilimanjaro.</p>

            <h3>Dome Mountains</h3>
            <img src="./images/dome mountains.jpg" alt="Dome Mountains">
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Dome mountains are formed when magma beneath the Earth's surface pushes up the crust, creating a dome-like shape.</p>
            <p><strong>Importance:</strong> These mountains are typically smooth and rounded, with minimal erosion at the surface.</p>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong> The Adirondack Mountains, the Black Hills.</p>

            <h3>Residual Mountains</h3>
            <img src="./images/resudial mounatains.webp" alt="Residual Mountains">
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Residual mountains are the remains of older mountain ranges that have been eroded over millions of years.</p>
            <p><strong>Importance:</strong> These mountains are usually lower in elevation and are formed from more resistant rock layers after the softer rocks have eroded away.</p>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong> The Scottish Highlands, the Ozarks.</p>

            <h3>Plateau Mountains</h3>
            <img src="./images/pleateau mountains.jpg" alt="Plateau Mountains">
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Plateau mountains are created when tectonic forces push up a plateau, and erosion carves into the plateau to form steep mountain slopes.</p>
            <p><strong>Importance:</strong> These mountains often have flat tops and are vital for various ecosystems and human habitation.</p>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong> The Colorado Plateau, the Deosai Plateau.</p>

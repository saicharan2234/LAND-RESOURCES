          <h3>surface water</h3>
          <img src="./images/surface water.jpg" alt="Loam Soil">
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Surface water includes rivers, lakes, and streams that are visible on the Earthâ€™s surface. It is essential for drinking, agriculture, and industrial uses. Surface water systems are connected to the surrounding land and are influenced by rainfall and runoff.</p>
        <p><strong>Uses:</strong> Surface water provides critical drinking water, supports irrigation for crops, and is used in industries for cooling and processing. It also provides habitats for aquatic life, supports biodiversity, and is crucial for recreational activities like fishing, boating, and swimming.</p>
        <p>Surface water is essential for hydroelectric power generation and is often stored in reservoirs to supply communities. Rivers and lakes contribute to transportation and play an important role in tourism and local economies. Wetlands, a type of surface water ecosystem, serve as natural filters for water purification.</p>
        <p><strong>Conservation Methods:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Implement watershed management practices to reduce pollution.</li>
          <li>Maintain natural vegetation around water bodies to prevent erosion.</li>
          <li>Regulate agricultural runoff by using buffer zones and sustainable practices.</li>
          <li>Promote responsible water usage and minimize waste in industries.</li>
          <li>Restore and protect wetlands to support biodiversity and water filtration.</li>
          <li>Encourage community involvement in clean-up and protection efforts.</li>

            <h3>ground water</h3>
            <img src="./images/ground water.jpeg" alt="Loam Soil">
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Groundwater is the water found beneath the Earth's surface in soil and rock formations. It is stored in aquifers and replenished through the process of infiltration. Groundwater is a major source of drinking water worldwide.</p>
        <p><strong>Uses:</strong> Groundwater supplies wells and boreholes for drinking water, supports irrigation, and is used in industries that require consistent water sources. It also plays a critical role in maintaining river flows and wetlands, especially during dry periods.</p>
        <p>Groundwater is essential for agricultural irrigation, especially in regions with limited surface water. It provides stability for soil and is a natural source of clean water for remote communities. In some areas, groundwater is essential for geothermal energy production.</p>
        <p><strong>Conservation Methods:</strong> Promote water-efficient farming practices, such as drip irrigation, to reduce over-extraction. Protect recharge zones by minimizing urban development. Limit pollutants from entering groundwater by managing waste and using eco-friendly fertilizers. Monitor groundwater levels and encourage sustainable usage.</p>

        <article class="soil-card">
            <h3>Rainwater</h3>
            <img src="./images/rain water.jpeg" alt="Loam Soil">
        
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Rainwater is the water that falls from the atmosphere as precipitation. It replenishes surface and groundwater sources and is an important water resource, especially in areas with high rainfall.</p>
        <p><strong>Uses:</strong> Rainwater is collected for drinking, irrigation, and household uses. It helps refill reservoirs and supports plant growth, promoting agriculture. Rainwater harvesting systems provide water for domestic use and are a sustainable solution in water-scarce areas.</p>
        <p>In urban areas, rainwater is used for landscaping and reduces the burden on municipal water supplies. It is also used in cooling systems, cleaning, and as emergency water supplies. Rainwater can recharge aquifers and improve soil health by reducing the need for groundwater extraction.</p>
        <p><strong>Conservation Methods:</strong> Install rainwater harvesting systems to capture runoff. Use permeable surfaces to enhance natural infiltration. Implement green infrastructure like green roofs and rain gardens to manage stormwater and reduce flood risk. Educate communities about the benefits of rainwater harvesting.</p>

      <!-- Desalinated Water --><center> 
      <article class="water-card">
        <article class="soil-card">
            <h3>desalinated water</h3>
            <img src="./images/desalinated water.jpg" alt="Loam Soil">
        
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Desalinated water is produced by removing salt and minerals from seawater or brackish water, making it suitable for drinking and irrigation. It is a critical resource in arid and coastal regions with limited freshwater sources.</p>
        <p><strong>Uses:</strong> Desalinated water provides drinking water for communities and supports agriculture in dry regions. It is used in industrial processes that require pure water. Many coastal cities rely on desalination plants to meet their growing water demands.</p>
        <p>Desalinated water is essential for sustaining communities in areas with high population density and low rainfall. It supports ecosystems and tourism, especially in desert regions. Desalination is also important for naval operations and maritime industries.</p>
        <p><strong>Conservation Methods:</strong> Improve desalination efficiency to reduce energy use. Minimize brine discharge to protect marine ecosystems. Promote water-saving technologies alongside desalination. Encourage the use of renewable energy in desalination plants to lower environmental impact.</p>

      <!-- Recycled Water --><center>
      <article class="water-card">
        <article class="soil-card">
            <h3>Recycled water</h3>
            <img src="./images/recylced water.jpg" alt="Loam Soil">
        
      
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Recycled water is wastewater that has been treated and purified for reuse. It can be used for various non-drinking purposes, providing an efficient way to extend water supplies.</p>
        <p><strong>Uses:</strong> Recycled water is used for irrigation in agriculture and landscaping, industrial cooling, and flushing toilets. It supports park and green space maintenance, reducing pressure on potable water sources.</p>
        <p>Recycled water is essential in areas facing water scarcity. It is used to recharge aquifers, protect natural habitats, and restore ecosystems. Many industries use recycled water to reduce operational costs and minimize freshwater use.</p>
        <p><strong>Conservation Methods:</strong> Implement greywater systems for household reuse. Educate the public about recycled water benefits. Encourage businesses to use recycled water in their processes. Ensure wastewater treatment plants meet high standards to provide safe, high-quality recycled water.</p>

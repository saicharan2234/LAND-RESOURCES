                <img src="./images/arable.jpg" alt="Arable Land">
          <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Arable land refers to land that is suitable for growing crops. It is vital for the production of food crops such as grains, vegetables, and fruits.</p>
          <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Arable land supports the foundation of agriculture by providing space for crop production, essential for feeding the global population. The sustainability of arable land is crucial for food security and the global economy.</p>
          <p>Effective management and protection of arable land are vital to maintain its fertility and productivity over time, ensuring that it can support future generations of farming.</p>
          <p><strong>Conservation Methods:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Adopt sustainable farming practices such as crop rotation and no-till farming.</li>
            <li>Prevent soil erosion using cover crops and contour farming.</li>
            <li>Implement efficient irrigation systems to optimize water usage.</li>
            <li>Minimize the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides to protect soil health.</li>
            <li>Encourage agroecological practices to maintain soil fertility and biodiversity.</li>

                <h3>Pasture Land</h3>

          <img src="./images/pasture.jpg" alt="Pasture Land">
          <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Pasture land is used for grazing livestock. It typically consists of natural grasslands or planted grasses that are maintained for livestock feeding.</p>
          <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Pasture land is critical for the livestock industry, supporting the production of meat, milk, and other animal products. Well-managed pasture systems can also contribute to carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation.</p>
          <p>The sustainability of pasture lands is key for maintaining healthy grazing systems and preventing land degradation.</p>
          <p><strong>Conservation Methods:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Implement rotational grazing systems to prevent overgrazing.</li>
            <li>Restore degraded pastures using reseeding and soil amendments.</li>
            <li>Maintain biodiversity by protecting native plant species.</li>
            <li>Incorporate agroforestry practices into pasture management.</li>
            <li>Use sustainable water management practices to support livestock hydration.</li>

          <h3>Wetlands & Floodplains</h3>
          <img src="./images/flood plian.jpeg" alt="Wetlands and Floodplains">
          <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Wetlands and floodplains are lands that are regularly flooded and often used for growing water-intensive crops like rice. They are important for water filtration and flood regulation.</p>
          <p><strong>Importance:</strong> These lands are critical for maintaining biodiversity, controlling floods, and filtering water. They also support rice cultivation, which is a staple crop for millions of people worldwide.</p>
          <p>Wetlands and floodplains play an essential role in regulating local water cycles and maintaining ecosystem services that support agriculture.</p>
          <p><strong>Conservation Methods:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Protect wetlands from drainage and conversion for urban development.</li>
            <li>Restore natural wetland functions through replanting and water management techniques.</li>
            <li>Promote sustainable rice farming in floodplain areas.</li>
            <li>Enhance flood protection measures to prevent land degradation.</li>
            <li>Integrate wetland conservation into agricultural land use planning.</li>

          <h3>Forested Land</h3>
          <img src="./images/forsted.jpg" alt="Forested Land">
          <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Forested land is used for timber production and the collection of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) like fruits, nuts, and resins. It provides important ecosystem services.</p>
          <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Forested land is essential for biodiversity, water cycle regulation, carbon sequestration, and providing raw materials for industries. Forests also support local economies through the harvest of timber and NTFPs.</p>
          <p>Managing forested land responsibly is essential for ensuring that forests continue to provide their ecological, economic, and social benefits sustainably.</p>
          <p><strong>Conservation Methods:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Implement sustainable forest management practices to prevent deforestation.</li>
            <li>Promote agroforestry systems that integrate trees into agricultural landscapes.</li>
            <li>Enforce policies to protect forests from illegal logging and land conversion.</li>
            <li>Restore degraded forest lands through reforestation and afforestation efforts.</li>

          <h3>Urban Agricultural Land</h3>
          <img src="./images/urban agriculture.jpeg" alt="Urban Agricultural Land">
          <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Urban agricultural land refers to land within cities or towns that is used for growing food, including community gardens and rooftop farms.</p>
          <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Urban agriculture provides fresh food to city dwellers, reduces food transportation costs, and helps enhance urban food security. It also contributes to green spaces and improves the local microclimate.</p>
          <p>Urban agriculture is becoming increasingly important in the context of climate change, population growth, and urbanization.</p>
          <p><strong>Conservation Methods:</strong></p>

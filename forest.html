          <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Tropical rainforests are dense, humid forests located near the equator. They receive high rainfall throughout the year, supporting a wide variety of plant and animal species.</p>
          <p><strong>Uses:</strong> Tropical rainforests provide timber, medicinal plants, and various fruits and nuts. They play a crucial role in the carbon cycle by absorbing carbon dioxide and maintaining global climate stability. They are also home to indigenous communities and provide critical resources for local economies.</p>
          <p>Rainforests also provide habitat for a vast number of species and are a vital source of biodiversity. They are a source of valuable resources like rubber, cocoa, and essential oils.</p>
          <p><strong>Conservation Methods:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Promote sustainable logging practices to avoid deforestation.</li>
            <li>Establish protected areas and enforce laws to prevent illegal logging.</li>
            <li>Support reforestation and afforestation projects.</li>
            <li>Encourage eco-friendly tourism to generate revenue for conservation efforts.</li>
            <li>Raise awareness about the importance of tropical rainforests for biodiversity and climate regulation.</li>

          <img src="./images/temparate.jpg" alt="Temperate Forest">
          <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Temperate forests are characterized by moderate climates and distinct seasons, with cold winters and warm summers. These forests are found in regions like North America, Europe, and parts of Asia.</p>
          <p><strong>Uses:</strong> Temperate forests provide a variety of hardwoods like oak, maple, and beech, which are used for construction, furniture, and paper production. They also offer recreational spaces and contribute to the cycling of carbon and oxygen in the atmosphere.</p>
          <p>Temperate forests support a wide variety of plants and animals, contributing to biodiversity. These forests also provide ecosystem services like water filtration and erosion control.</p>
          <p><strong>Conservation Methods:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Protect existing temperate forests through national parks and nature reserves.</li>
            <li>Promote responsible forest management to reduce deforestation and habitat loss.</li>
            <li>Support tree planting and forest restoration projects.</li>
            <li>Educate communities about the importance of sustainable forestry practices.</li>
            <li>Encourage sustainable timber sourcing through certification programs.</li>

          <h3>Boreal Forest</h3>
          <img src="./images/boreal.jpg" alt="Boreal Forest">
          <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Boreal forests, also known as taiga, are located in cold northern regions like Canada, Russia, and Scandinavia. These forests consist mostly of coniferous trees, which are adapted to the harsh, cold climate.</p>
          <p><strong>Uses:</strong> Boreal forests provide timber and are an important source of pulp for paper production. They also play a crucial role in carbon sequestration, helping to regulate global climate by absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide.</p>
          <p>The boreal forest is home to a variety of species, including wolves, moose, and lynx, and provides important ecosystem services like water filtration and climate regulation.</p>
          <p><strong>Conservation Methods:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Minimize logging activities in vulnerable boreal ecosystems.</li>
            <li>Support conservation initiatives that focus on protecting migratory species and habitats.</li>
            <li>Promote the use of sustainable forestry practices to reduce ecological damage.</li>
            <li>Work to preserve large tracts of undisturbed boreal forest to maintain ecological balance.</li>
            <li>Encourage policies that mitigate the effects of climate change on boreal forests.</li>
